To use cmake with avr_bridge and the arduiono,
copy the examke CMakeList.txt to your project directory along with the
cmake_scripts directory.  Then:

1.  Modify the project name
2.  Set the location of the arduino hardware source code.  For
    the example application, the source code has been copied into
    a folder called "arduino" in the project directory
2.  Choose which arduiono board you are using by including the correct
    cmake script.  By default, the arduino diecimila is included.
3.  Add your src files to the PROJECT_SRC variable.
