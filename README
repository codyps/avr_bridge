avr_bridge

by Adam Stambler of Rutgers University

avr_bridge is meant to simplify the use of an Arduino and avr processors
in a ROS based robot by providing a partial ROS implementation in avr c++.
In hobbyist robotics, these microcontrollers are often used to read sensors
and perform low level motor control. Every time a robot needs to interface
with an AVR board, a new communication system is written. Typically they
all use a usb-to-serial converter and either a custom binary or text 
based protocol. AVR bridge replaces these custom protocols with an 
automatically generated ROS communication stack that allows the AVR 
processors to directly publish or subscribe to ROS topics.
